Game written in C programming language using software rendering technique called Raycasting based on Wolfenstein 3D original game.

Please note that this code is ***PURE MESS***. Do not use it, it's not production ready in any way. I cannot support you if you'll use it. This repository is for learning purposes and to motivate myself to finish 7D FPS GameJam.
